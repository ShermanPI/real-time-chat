- [x] Create a `server` folder with `index.js` and start an Express app with a port passed as an environment variable.
- [x] Run the web server.
- [x] Create a script in `package.json` to run the project with `node --watch`.
- [x] Research what `morgan` is and install it.
- [x] make a client folder where you will have the index.html file 
- [ ] create the chat in the index.html
- [ ] send the file index.html in the routepath "/" using res.sendFile and process.cwd() 
- [ ] install socket.io (io standing for (in / out)) explay why using socket.io and how this make the things easier like making a "handshake" with the client
- [ ] create a node:http server passing the express app as parameter (explain why you do it)
- [ ] create a new socket io server and pass the node:http server as a parameter
- [ ] put the node:http server to listen instead of expressjs app
- [ ] after instantiate the webSocket make an .on('connection', callBack) so you know when an user is connected to the socket
- [ ] in the client import io from the cdn socket.io.esm.min.js
- [ ] (client) make a socket and store it in a variable that will be doing connection with the server (you can pass the server url, but its good to know socket.io will lool in the same server for the conection)
- [ ] print when the user is connected, and when is disconnected
- [ ] (client) emit a chat message from the UI
- [ ] set in the socket that when the client send a chat message you can see it in the console
- [ ] make a broadcasting after an user send a message (üìù Broadcasting means sending a message to all connected clients except the sender. )
- [ ] you can use turso, so you can use an sql database 
- [ ] create table messages (id, message)
- [ ] after an user send a message save the message and emit the message with the new id created to the client
- [ ] ‚ö° make an serverOffset so you know which message was the last one for the user ad load them from there
- [ ] make sure the user receive the messages when it was disconnected (use socket.recovered)

NOTES:
 - everytime an user emit something in the socket the property {auth} in the "io" instance will make sure the message always goes with this.
    You can see this information in the socket.handshake
